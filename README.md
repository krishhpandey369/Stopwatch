# ⏱ Stopwatch Application

This project is a simple Python program that works like a basic stopwatch.
It uses Tkinter, Python’s built-in GUI library, to create a clean and easy-to-use interface.
The stopwatch can start, stop, and reset the timer, and updates the time every second.
The main purpose of this project was to learn how GUI applications work and how to handle time updates in Python.

The interface is lightweight, beginner-friendly, and smooth to use.

# 🧪 Testing the Application

The stopwatch was tested to make sure it works smoothly in all situations:

✔ Timer starts immediately when Start is pressed

✔ Timer stops instantly when Stop is pressed

✔ Time updates perfectly every second

✔ Multiple timers do NOT start even if Start is clicked many times
